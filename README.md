 Giant Forest Inn Hotel

#Case Study a: Giant Forest Inn Hotel by Rober Stumpf
History
After World I and before the stock market crash that led to the Great Depression was a period of great prosperity in the United States. Many of the people who lived during this time say that it was even better than the prosperity of the 1990s. One of the persons who accumulated a sizeable amount of capital was Fred Manger. He decided to sell all his securities before the stock market crash and build a first-class resort hotel on his mountain property. 
	He succeeded in every way. By 1972, he had built a 100-room hotel containing five stories, which he called Giant Forest Inn. To go with it, he had many amenities, such as tennis courts, sauna baths, stables with a covered horseback trail, boat rentals, a ballroom, five dining rooms, and both an indoor and an out-door swimming pool. The tile work on these poos was a work of art. He also had built 25 cottages with garages in the wooded area near the Inn. These cottages provided seclusion for the guests and also security for their handcrafted automobiles. The service and food were outstanding, and his resort hotel became almost immediately one of the top hotels in the world. The prices were very expensive, but many people who prospered during this time could easily afford the high prices. 
	With the beginning of the Great Depression, operation had to be cut back because of the low occupancy rate. By the time World War II began, the Inn had to be shut down. Unfortunately, Fred never lived to see it open again. In 1946, after World War II was over, Fred’s son Howard leased the property to Belton Hotels. Belton Hotels was a chain with hotels all over the world, and its managers supposedly had the expertise to operate such a fine hotel. Belton lowered its standards and was able to operate it with a reasonable profit. After 20 years, however, Belton Hotels discontinued the lease, leaving Howard again with empty property.


The Beginning of the New Company
In 1967, Howard’s son Bill was finishing business school and was looking for an opportunity to run a business. He asked his father for permission to create a new corporation to run the Inn. Howard liked the idea. Bill had a close friend named Roger Morris who had recently graduated from law school and who helped with obtaining additional capital to use for repairs. Bill did not re-open the cottages, as they were expensive to maintain. However, the new corporation did issue bond in order to build a new three-story bungalow with 80 more rooms and 15 conference rooms. When the bungalow completed in 1959, the Inn was again a stable business. Many aerospace firms booked the conference rooms for retreats. Also, many of the engineers came back to bring their families, and finally the Inn was again profitable. In the 1990s, the Inn became popular with the new Internet companies. 

Major Event and Reorientation of the Inn 
In September of 2000, a fire broke out in the bungalow, and it was damage sufficiently to be condemned for further use. The only option was to have it demolished. This left Bill and Roger with some major decision to make. After they did an analysis of the market, they realized that there was a sufficient base of customers who liked the original Inn for its charm. Also, there was a large demand for the cottages from guests who lived in foreign countries. They decided not to rebuild the bungalow but instead to renovate the cottages. They also hired a world-famous chef and began to offer fine food. The hotel they now envisioned would be true five star hotel. 

Rooms Referred to by Name, Not by a Number
The guests the Giant Forest Inn is now dealing with want to be treated like celebrities. Fred had originally named each guest room, such as the George Washington Room or the Abraham Lincoln Room. Thus, most customers ask for their favourite room by name when they make a reservation. If the specific room is not important, this is also noted on the reservation. Most reservation, except for cottages, are charged one night’s lodging as a deposit. Cottages typically require a deposit of one month’s rent

Special Check-in Services
Guests check in upon arrival when a credit card is presented or a deposit is paid. Their address and guest data are already on the check-in form. Usually, all they need to do is sign it if a reservation was made. Walk-ins (those who do not have reservations) are accepted as long as there is room. A quick reservation is made for them, and from then on, they are treated as regular guests. 

Special system to Handle Receipts for Services 
Guest wish to be able to charge services by using their own name and not a room number. In fact, many guest expect the Inn staff not to ask who they are. They feel the staff should remember them. The guests do not want to sign receipts for service during meals or while ordering drinks from the lounge. So Fred devices a system where all receipts at the end of the day are hand-delivered to the guest’s room.

Some rooms Leased Instead of Rented 
Many guests want to stay for two months or longer. Some guests in the cottages actually want to stay for as long as a year. Thus, a lease is used instead of a simple room registration. Leased rooms are billed once a month. Ordinary rooms are charged each night. A bill for the amount due is presented the night before check-out, and it is paid before the guest leaves. 

Special Check-out Procedures
The guests expect not to have to wait in line to check out. The night before they are to leave, a bill is hand-delivered to their room. If all is okay, they do nothing; however, if there are problems, they call the Inn’s bookkeeping department. and adjustments are made. Then a new copy is hand-delivered to them. Payment is done mostly by check or credit card. Figure 1 shows an example of a bill. 


Computer System Problems
The computer system which Giant Forest Inn had leased was created not for hotels serving this type of clientele but for convention hotels. After checking with other vendors of computer systems, Bill and Roger realized none of them could satisfy the unique needs of their guests. It was time to create a new custom hotel reservation and guest management system. 

The New Computing System needs to: 
1.	Provide a web interface to make reservation which automatic mailing (via mail or social message) of reservation confirmations. 
2.	Track room status (ready, occupied, under repair, not ready).
3.	Track room cleaning and laundry (when to issue new sheets).
4.	Trak all services (check-in and/or check-out) and present the guests with a bill at the end of each day; guests may then adjust these bills by adding tips for good service.
